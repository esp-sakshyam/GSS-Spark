Project Overview:
This project is an off-grid Emergency Response System designed for remote areas (like rural Nepal) where internet, cellular networks, and power are unreliable.
The system uses ESP32 + LoRa mesh networking + sensors + basic on-device AI to detect emergencies and transmit alerts over long distances without relying on mobile networks or satellites.

The web component is not the core system, but a monitoring and control layer that receives data from a gateway node and displays it to authorities.

Landing page design:
Make a minimalistic clean and sharp UI. it must not look anything like AI. no purples no bluish gradient. add illustrations and add animations.
