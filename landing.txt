Project Overview:
This project is an off-grid Emergency Response System designed for remote areas (like rural Nepal) where internet, cellular networks, and power are unreliable.
The system uses ESP32 + LoRa mesh networking + sensors + basic on-device AI to detect emergencies and transmit alerts over long distances without relying on mobile networks or satellites.

The web component is not the core system, but a monitoring and control layer that receives data from a gateway node and displays it to authorities.

Landing page design:
Make a minimalistic clean and sharp UI. it must not look anything like AI. no purples no bluish gradient. add illustrations and add animations. in the hero section, add an illustration which shows the working of the system. make it show something like a sender module in the hills is pinging to the base station. add some pulsing heart beats. dont add AI looking border radiuses. try keeping the edges sharp and clean. dont jumble many things all at once. keep the UI clean and minimal. the nav bar should very minimal things. 
1) hero section
2) working principle (animated illustration)
3) tech stack
4) footer (not needed in the nav bar)
